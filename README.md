# nickel
iPad interface for using controlled microphone feedback as a musical instrument

Uses TouchOSC to construct a MIDI interface which sends and receives data to/from SuperCollider. Used for my thesis composition 'The Giant and the Silver Nickel' to generate and modulate acoustic feedback from drums, which is then combined with mixer feedback.
